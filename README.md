# Windows.Devices.Radios.nRF24L01
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) driver for the nRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver. The driver targets "Any CPU" but I have only tested it on the Raspberry Pi2 running Windows10 IoT Core. 

This project is based on these two projects: 
* The RF24 Arduino driver from maniacbug (https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24) 
* The nRF24L01Plus .NETMF driver from JohnMasen (http://nrf24l01plus.codeplex.com/)
